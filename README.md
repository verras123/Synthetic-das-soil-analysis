# Synthetic-das-soil-analysis
Synthetic DAS-based soil analysis for exploratory and demonstration purposes.

Synthetic DAS-Based Soil Analysis
End-to-end synthetic Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) soil analysis workflow for exploratory analysis, visualization and methodological benchmarking.
This repository is intended as a research and demonstration project, focusing on signal processing, statistical analysis and classification concepts applied to DAS-like synthetic data.

Scope and intent
This project provides a synthetic, self-contained and Colab-oriented environment to explore how DAS-style signals and piezo-acoustic modeling can be used to analyze and differentiate soil and rock classes.
The repository is designed to:
•	demonstrate signal processing and analysis workflows,
•	evaluate statistical separability of geotechnical classes,
•	visualize depth-dependent elastic properties,
•	and support methodological prototyping.
It is not intended to represent a calibrated field system, operational monitoring solution or site-specific inversion workflow.

Repository contents
•	analise_de_solo_DAS_sintetico.txt
Standalone script implementing synthetic DAS signal generation, processing and soil analysis.
•	analysis_outputs.txt
Textual summary of results generated by the script, including statistical metrics, classification performance and diagnostic messages.
•	images/
Representative figures automatically produced during script execution, illustrating signal behavior, estimated parameters and dataset composition.
•	README.md
Project description and usage guidelines.

Execution environment
This project is designed to be executed exclusively in Google Colab.
Recommended usage
1.	Open Google Colab.
2.	Create a new notebook.
3.	Upload analise_de_solo_DAS_sintetico.txt.
4.	Copy and paste the script into a notebook cell.
5.	Execute the cell to generate outputs and figures.
Local execution is not supported by design.

Description of generated outputs
The file analysis_outputs.txt contains the outputs produced during script execution and reflects the results, not the methodology itself.
Reported outputs include:
•	selection of a target soil or rock class,
•	descriptive statistics of P-wave velocity (Vp) by class (count, mean, median, standard deviation),
•	diagnostic warnings and numerical edge cases inherent to synthetic data,
•	classification accuracy metrics comparing estimated properties against ground-truth labels,
•	execution status and output directory information.
All reported values are derived from synthetic signals and are intended for exploratory and comparative analysis only.

Data and modeling assumptions
•	All signals are synthetically generated.
•	No field data, client data or proprietary datasets are used.
•	Physical parameters are representative but not calibrated.
•	Results illustrate methodological behavior rather than site-specific truth.
Any numerical artifacts, extreme values or class imbalance effects reflect realistic challenges encountered in experimental pipelines.

Interpretation disclaimer
The outputs and figures provided in this repository:
•	do not represent field measurements,
•	do not replace geophysical surveys or laboratory testing,
•	should not be used for engineering, safety or operational decisions.
They are provided strictly for research, demonstration and educational purposes.

Relationship to other projects
This repository is independent and self-contained.
It does not include:
•	production monitoring systems,
•	proprietary workflows,
•	client-specific implementations,
•	or internal project code from other initiatives.
Any conceptual similarity to larger systems (e.g., DAS monitoring platforms or CO2-related projects) is purely methodological and abstract.

License
This project is released under the MIT License.
You are free to read, use and adapt the code for research and educational purposes, provided that proper attribution is maintained.

Final note
This repository intentionally prioritizes:
•	clarity over completeness,
•	transparency over performance claims,
•	and methodological exploration over operational deployment.
It is meant to be read, inspected and understood — not blindly executed as a production system.
